But JSON is much easier to work. [RSS2JSON](https://rss2json.com/#rss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss) is a free online Api that will convert the given XML to JSON. And the best part is you can do the whole process at once, you don't have to get the XML first then convert it to JSON.

**Api Url :** " https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=https://medium.com/feed/@USERNAME "


The result will be something like this and in JSON format

Now just fetch the object and you are done !! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹

```js

fetch('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=https://medium.com/feed/@USERNAME')
  .then((res) => res.json();
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
